**Mission Statement (maximum 60 words):**  
My mission is to revolutionize agriculture in Rwanda by creating a smart, localized machine learning platform for hydroponic systems. I aim to tackle the knowledge gap and high costs by delivering precise, accessible guidance through the application of my software engineering and machine learning skills. This will boost yields, ensure climate resilience, and empower smallholder farmers on limited land.

**Mission Capstone Project Title:**  
FarmSmart Rwanda: Bridging Knowledge Gaps with AI-Powered Hydroponics software system.

## **Narrative**

Rwanda’s agricultural sector faces mounting challenges: low crop yields, climate variability, soil erosion, and limited arable land. With less than half of the country’s land suitable for farming, much of it on steep slopes, traditional agriculture struggles to meet growing food demands (Waithaka et al., 2013).

Hydroponic farming offers a transformative solution. By growing crops without soil and using nutrient-rich water, hydroponics reduces dependence on rainfall, conserves land, and enables year-round production (National Agricultural Library, n.d.; Mastercard Foundation, 2023). This is especially promising for urban and peri-urban areas where space is limited and climate shocks are frequent (United Nations Development Programme, 2025).

However, adoption remains slow due to high technical costs and a lack of localized knowledge. Farmers often lack access to expert guidance, and existing systems are often based on foreign models not tailored to Rwanda’s specific needs (Gana, B. S., et al., 2024; Grozine, 2025). This challenge is amplified because managing critical parameters like nutrient concentration (EC) requires scientific precision, which can lead to crop failure if mismanaged (Jones, J. B., 2005).

This is where FarmSmart comes in. FarmSmart is an AI-powered software platform designed to make hydroponics simple, affordable, and scalable. It uses localized machine learning to convert complex scientific data into accessible, context-aware advice.

By bridging the knowledge gap and lowering technical barriers, FarmSmart empowers smallholder farmers to thrive on limited land, boost productivity, and build climate resilience (Dutta et al., 2025; Mastercard Foundation, 2023). It aligns with Rwanda’s national goal to shift agriculture from subsistence to a knowledge-driven, market-oriented sector, making it a practical and high-impact solution to securing food and water.

## **Mission-Related Activities**

These activities highlight the critical efforts undertaken to ground the FarmSmart platform in local realities, needs, and existing agricultural networks in Rwanda.

* Farm Visit: Ezaneza Farm (Muhanga): Conducting direct fieldwork at Ezaneza farm to study operational practices, technical challenges, and the specific data requirements of a working hydroponic farm environment ([https://ezaneza.com/](https://ezaneza.com/)).  
* Farm Visit: Ndego Farms: Gaining contextual knowledge and observing successful small-to-medium scale agricultural operations to inform the scalability and user experience of the FarmSmart platform ([https://ndegofarmventures.com/](https://ndegofarmventures.com/)).  
* AyuteChallenge Final Presentation (Kigali 2025): Attended the final presentation to analyze cutting-edge agricultural technology trends and youth-led innovation in Rwanda, ensuring FarmSmart remains aligned with the latest local solutions and market needs ([https://ayute.africa/rwanda](https://ayute.africa/rwanda)).  
* Membership: Agriculture (Food Systems and Food Security) Board: Active participation provides access to strategic opportunities, expert perspectives, and networking essential for the future pilot and scaling of the FarmSmart platform across student and professional communities.
